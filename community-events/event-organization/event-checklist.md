# Event Guide

A quick guide for community leaders, with tips on speaker sourcing, event promotion, and more.

## Start organizing your event

### Basic definition:
- Type of content: presentations or workshop
- Ideal format for your community: online, hybrid or in-person
- Date and time
- Duration: 1-2 hours
     - If you opt for an online event, consider breaking the event into 30-45 minute sessions.
     - For in-person event, consider a 15-minute break for participants to network.
- Theme: will focus on one or more themes from the project's content pack **Enterprise-grade Reference Architecture for JavaScript?**
- Prerequisites: If you have activities related with accounts or services (e.g. create a GitHub), include this information on the registration page and send the reminder for your attendees. It will be very useful and you will save time.

### Promotion
- Use our templates to create assets and promote your event. In the [Creative](/Creative) folder, you will find the downloadable templates:
     - Event cover for Meetup
     - Card for speakers
     - Background and thumbnail for YouTube
     - Video background for Instagram and TikTok
     - Power Point template
- Create the registration link for your event, using [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/), Microsoft Forms or another platform of your choice.
- Remember to include a code of conduct in your event. A CoC is important to ensure that all participants feel safe and comfortable during the event. Be inspired by the [Reactor Code of Conduct](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/CodeOfConduct/).
- Connect with local communities, universities, schools, to promote registration for your event.
- 5 and 2 days prior to the event, send a reminder email to your attendees list and encourage them to share the event with their friends and co-workers.
- On the day of the event, send a final reminder with link to access the online event or tips to find the location (if in-person).

### Finding speakers
If you want to find speakers for your event, you can search for members of Microsoft's community programs:

- [Find an MVP (Most Valuable Professional)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/pt-br/MvpSearch)
- [Find an MSLA (Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador)](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/pt-BR/search?target=Profile)

Tip: in your invite, talk about the **Enterprise-grade Reference Architecture for JavaScript** project and share the content you want the speaker to present.
