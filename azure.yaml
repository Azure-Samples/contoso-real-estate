    # The portal is a static web apps site with an API.
    # Here we only need to specify the location of the static app.
    # Because azd uses the Azure Static Web Apps CLI under the hood (azd deploy),
    # We configured the app to use the Azure Functions API
    # at packages/api as a backend. The configuration lives
    # in swa-cli.config.json.
