# Document overview: Setup

This document will guide you through the prerequisites and commands necessary to setup and preview the portal project, locally on your computer.

It will also instruct you how to deploy it to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview), to publish it to the cloud!

## Prerequisites

In order to start the development server for local development or locally browsing the portal site, the following technologies must be installed in your computer:

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS, with the corresponding npm version
- [Azure Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

## Dependencies

This scenario depends on the following scenarios:

- Scenario 1: [Building a frontend application with Static Web Apps, Azure Functions and Cosmos DB](./../scenario-1/0-intro.md)
- Scenario 3: [Building and deploying a micro-frontend blog app capability for the portal served by a headless CMS deployed to Azure Container Apps](./../scenario-3/0-intro.md)

Please make sure you have completed the steps in those scenarios before continuing.

## Setup scenario 4

In order to complete the setup for this scenario, you will need to complete the following steps:

- [ ] Fork or clone the repository locally
- [ ] Install the dependencies for the portal project
- [ ] Start the development server for the portal project
- [ ] Start the development server for the API project
- [ ] Start the development server for the blog project

We are going to be using the Azure Static Web Apps in-built authentication capability, to authenticate users and allow them to favorite listings and complete booking payments.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
