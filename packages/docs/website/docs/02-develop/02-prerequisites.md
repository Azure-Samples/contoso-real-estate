## Developer Tools

![Developer tools and workflows](./../../static/docs/png/contoso-devtools.png)

You should be able to complete this tutorial using any preferred text editor and terminal environment for local development. However, we recommend using Visual Studio Code for a simpler, streamlined developer experience.
 * [Get Started With Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)

Visual Studio Code offers a number of powerful _Extensions_ that can improve developer productivity by default. We'll identify relevant extensions you can install for each scenario, as we develop them.
 * [Explore Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode)

An added benefit of using Visual Studio Code is the ability to work with _GitHub Codespaces_ to move seamlessly from your local environment to using VS Code in the browser (powered by a GitHub Cloud-hosted environment).

## Command-Line Utilities

We also have a number of command-line tools (CLI) that can simplify your local development experience. We'll identify these in relevant scenarios, as we build. For now, here's a list of tools for reference:
 - Azure Developer CLI
 - Azure Static Web Apps CLI
 - Azure Core Functions Tools
 - Playwright Test
