description: Let's talk about how the Contoso Real Estate Application was developed.

# Overview

The [reference implementation](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate) demonstrates how to build a modern web application (Contoso Rentals) via a _series of extensible scenarios_, using best-in-class developer tools with relevant Azure and 3rd-party service integrations.

![E2E Reference Architecture For Contoso Real Estate](./../../../../../assets/diagrams/e2e-full-horizontal.drawio.png)

Here is what the final architecture (with 7 scenarios) looks like. The scenarios are designed to be self-contained and usable as a reference for your own projects.

1.  **Setup**: Some of the scenarios require a setup step, to prepare your environment for the development of the application. The setup steps are described in the corresponding scenario folder.
2.  **Dependencies**: Some of the scenarios have dependencies on other scenarios. For example, scenario 4 depends on scenarios 1 and 3. In this case, the setup steps for scenario 4 will include references to the setup steps for those scenarios.

## What You'll Build

In this tutorial, you'll create a serverless web application that enables enterprise users to look for (and reserve) temporary home rentals in a desired location. You'll build the application as a series of 8 scenarios, each showcasing best practices for developing core modern web app features including:

- Static Web App Hosting
- Serverless API Integration
- Serverless Database Integration
- Federated User Authentication
- Integrated Search & Recommendations
- Integration with Third Party (Payments) API
- End-to-End Application Testing
- Application Monitoring & Insights

## What You'll Learn

- Designing a Composable Application Architecture
- Employing a Micro-Frontend Development Pattern
- Scaling with a Microservices-driven Backend
- Integrating automated End-to-End Testing
- Simplifying deployment with Azure Developer CLI Templates

## Cost To Complete

- We prioritize for services in the **[Azure Free Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/)** by default.
- We provide cost estimates (with [**Azure Pricing Calculator**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)) for usage beyond free tier.
- **Delete resources setup for this exercise** on completion to prevent future charges.
