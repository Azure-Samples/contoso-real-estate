What issues did you come across that the customer may also hit?

_Examples:_

- You forgot a config step - led to error in a certain task
- The SDK or CLI returned an confusing error.
- The SDK reference docs example would have been more helpful it it included ... please include exact link to ref doc.
- The pricing tier (free or basic) didn't support your scenario
- The portal or UI was confusing - more helpful if the button/textbox/etc was boxed and had an error.
