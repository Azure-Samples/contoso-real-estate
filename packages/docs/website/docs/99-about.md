Welcome to the Contoso Real Estate Application Developer Guide. We created this developer guide with three objectives in mind:
 1. **Specification** | Explain the user scenarios driving this solution.
 2. **Implementation** | Explore the architecture and codebase in context.
 3. **Contribution** | Encourage you to contribute with code & discussions.

## Workflow

The documentation is organized in a manner that reflects the end-to-end developer journey that typically consists of the following phases:

- **Define** - customer requirements, architecture decisions.
- **Develop** - prioritized scenarios, core services, developer tools.
- **Deploy** - resource provisioning, production environment, pricing.
- **DevOps** - end-to-end testing, CI/CD (workflow automation).
- **Data** - application insights, cost & performance optimization.

## Admonitions

Admonitions are color-coded boxes (like those shown below) that will show up in specific parts of the developer guide. Colors are used to draw attention to specific contexts or interaction opportunities.

:::tip PROMPT YOUR COPILOT
Green boxes indicate opportunities to engage with your AI Copilot to explore the code, or potentially extend it, for improved understanding.
:::

:::info DID YOU KNOW
Blue boxes highlight useful information that can help provide context, or reinforce key learnings, related to the associated section.
:::

:::danger HERE BE DRAGONS
Red boxes draw attention to actions or challenges that may lead to undesirable outcomes or gotchas for the application developer.
:::

:::caution HELP NEEDED
Yellow boxes identify stubs for documentation that is yet to be written, or that requires clarifications. These are great places to contribute!
