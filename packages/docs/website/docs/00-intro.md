**Welcome to the Developer Guide for the [Contoso Real Estate Reference Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-real-estate).**

The repository contains the reference architecture and implementation for a complex multi-scenario enterprise-grade application built on Microsoft Azure, with best-in-class developer tooling and technologies. 

It provides a JavaScript/Web developer with a comprehensive collection of architecture patterns, functional components, developer tools and best practices to streamline and enhance their productivity in building scalable solutions in cloud-native environments.

## Reference Application

The reference architecture is for an enterprise application (_Contoso Real Estate_) and designed specifically to **showcase popular feature requirements** - including web-based portals, user authentication, content management, serverless APIs, containerized services, integrated search, third-party payments, and end-to-end testing.

It also **showcases best-in-class developer tooling** for a consistent and productive end-to-end developer experience - from _GitHub Copilot_ (AI pair programmer), _GitHub Codespaces_ (consistent development enviroment) and _GitHub Actions_ (CI/CD) to _Visual Studio Code_ (authoring), _Playwright_ (testing) and _Azure Developer CLI_ (deployment).

Here's a sneak peek at what the application experience looks like:

## Developer Guide

In the following sections, we'll dive into the details behind this reference architecture and sample implementation, exploring it in four dimensions, reflecting the end-to-end developer workflow:
 - **Define** - Understand requirements, define architecture, setup environment.
 - **Develop** - Prioritize scenarios, implement with API-first, composabability in mind
 - **Deploy** -  Provision resources, validate deploy, activate monitoring & insights
 - **DevOps** -  Integrate end-to-end testing, automate CI/CD, optimize costs
