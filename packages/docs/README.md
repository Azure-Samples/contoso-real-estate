# Contoso Real Estate: Developer Guide

Welcome to the documentation site for the Contoso Real Estate reference implemenation. _This is a work in progress and contributions are welcome_.

## About The Guide

The guide is developed as a static website using the  [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) framework. _It is meant to be used in local preview (directions below) but you can configure it (e.g., in your local fork) to run as a GitHub Pages hosted site, or deployed to Azure Static Web Apps_.

The package also contains a local [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) test specification independent of the version used for the Contoso Real Estate app. _It is meant to be used for website migration validation only, and should not be viewed as part of the reference implementation testing strategy_.
