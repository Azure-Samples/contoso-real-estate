:::tip GUIDANCE

What was your development environment when you engineered this scenario?

I ran through this procedure on a (remove whatever doesn't apply - no expectation that you did this on all options):

- Win
- Mac
- Linux
- container
- VM

You generally interact with the environment with:

- keyboard short cuts - please use those when describing a task - just once - not exhaustively
- Command palatte in VSCode
- Bash commands that you developed to short-circuit longer commands
- etc

If the person writing up the steps doesn't understand how to get from A to C because your B was not obvious - that is what I'm looking for here.
