:::tip GUIDANCE

 What was your development environment when you engineered this scenario? 

I ran through this procedure on a (remove whatever doesn't apply - no expectation that you did this on all options):

* Win
* Mac
* Linux
* container
* VM

You generally interact with the environment with:

* keyboard short cuts - please use those when describing a task - just once - not exhaustively
* Command palatte in VSCode
* Bash commands that you developed to short-circuit longer commands
* etc

If the person writing up the steps doesn't understand how to get from A to C because your B was not obvious - that is what I'm looking for here.
