    * UI for blog and portal front ends
    * API layer to communicate between client and cloud
    * Microservices for cloud integrations
        * Identity for authentication and authorization
        * Storage for rental property images and rental contracts
        * Database for rental property details
        * Recommendation engine
        * Site search
        * Monitoring
        * Payments
